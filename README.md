# Pentestlab 

This repository contains examples to deploy a penetration testing lab on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) provisioned with [Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat), [Chef](https://chef.io/) and [Docker](https://docker.com/).  

It will deploy a `pentester` environment, where some services are available to perform some pentest tasks collaboratively. It will also provision target networks with vulnerables machines.
