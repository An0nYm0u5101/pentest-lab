# Lab services

There is several services configured on the lab:

## Gitrob
[Gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob) needs a github personal access token, create on on https://github.com and edit `gitrob` item of `pentester` data bag:
```
knife data bag edit pentester gitrob --secret-file .chef/encrypted_data_bag_secret
```
and update the `gh_auth_token` value.  

Gitrob is installed on [bliss](../provisioning/recipes/bliss.rb). Get it's ip address (`tun0`) and access to the web interface through url `http://10.13.37.x:9393`.  
You should be able to create new assessments.

The `gitrob` service is managed by docker. If the service is not running, check the `gitrob` container is started:
```
docker ps
```
If not started, check if container exists and remove it, then rerun `chef-client`:
```
docker ps -a
docker rm CONTAINERID
sudo chef-client
```
Access to service's logs with:
```
docker logs CONTAINERID
```

Run Gitrob command with:
```
docker exec -it CONTAINERID gitrob help
docker exec -it CONTAINERID gitrob analyze --no-server <username>
```
